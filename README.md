# MineSafe : IOT Based Smart Helmet for Mining Workers 

<h2>Abstarct</h2>

  Mining is recognized as one of the most hazardous occupations in the world. The mining industry has the highest incidence of occupational deaths. In order to reduce these risks and make mining safer, we are focusing on improving the helmets used by workers.
	Therefore, the main aim is to make the helmet even safer by adding an array of sensors to monitor environmental conditions, an emergency switch to trigger an alert in case of emergencies, GPS location tracking, along with a WiFi module for IoT communication. Additionally, the helmet incorporates an Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensor for fall detection, as well as a pre-recorded voice provided by a voice processor for alerts. The developed helmet system is primarily intended to improve the working environment in mines and ensure worker safety.
